# Stock classification using k-means clustering

This work presents an approach to use the K-means algorithm for stock classification, with the aim of helping investors to diversify their investment portfolios. ItÂ´s divided in 3 parts:

1. Clustering of stocks according to their average annualized return and average annualized volatility.

2. Clustering of shares according to their per (price-earnings ratio) and dividend rate

3. 3-dimensional analysis using the k-means++ algorithm using mean annualized return, mean annualized volatility and price-to-book ratio as a new dimension.
